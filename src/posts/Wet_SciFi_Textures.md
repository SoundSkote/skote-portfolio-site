#### **Wet Sci-Fi Textures Sound Pack (FREE)**


Hey everyone! I'm excited to share a new sound pack featuring 20 wet sci-fi textures that I recently created using Vital. Plus, it's available for free! ðŸŒŸ

Grab it here: <https://georgiosaudio.gumroad.com/l/wet-scifi-textures>

These sounds are a result of experimenting with Vital after being inspired by Negativist's video about these textures. I'd love to hear your thoughts and any feedback you have!
