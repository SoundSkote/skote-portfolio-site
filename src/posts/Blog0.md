Lyra Sound Redesign Blog 0 - Setting Up
---

</div>


Hi all!

I decided to start blogging my progress on a portfolio project I started. This project is a complete sound redesign of the sample game Lyra using Wwise. The aim of this project is to create a playable level that will allow me to showcase my skills but will also allow me to experiment and learn.This point of this redesign is not just replace the sounds on pre-existing systems but to create my own with my own sounds attached to them. For that reason, I am going to use Wwise instead of the pre-made Metasound systems. At the end of this blog series, I’ll also create a video showcasing my work. Any advice or feedback about the sound design or the implementation is much appreciated!

Before proceeding with this blog, please keep in mind that these systems are being made by a sound designer for other sound designers. Everything in this project will be made from a non-coder perspective for the purpose of exploring and creating interesting audio systems. However, I’ll try to optimise these systems as much as I can to create a better end product. 




#### So what is Lyra? 

Lyra is a third-person shooter sample game project for Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) made by Epic Games. I chose this game as it features many gameplay mechanics that allow me to create systems for, such as shooting and map interactions. Additionally, it is fully playable and will allow me to experiment with audio systems without having to create other systems such as animations and new assets, although I plan to add a few extra pieces. 

To make it easier for people to follow the progression, I’ll post a blog for each section of the game when it is completed. It seems that there will be around 6 blog posts in total covering the environment-ambience, the animations, the interactions, the weapons, the occlusion and reverb, and the overall mixing.


#### Wwise Integration

To start working on this project, I need to set things up. Firstly, I integrated Wwise 2023.1.2 and Unreal Engine 5.2. I wanted to use Wwise for two main reasons. Firstly, this is a purely personal project and although I’ve planned its production and deadlines, I have the flexibility to allow myself to experiment more in an environment that I’m already pretty familiar with. The second reason is that Lyra already uses UE’s Metasounds, so it wouldn’t be much of a technical challenge or a learning experience for me as most of the systems are already set inside.

#### Planning ahead

Before I start working, it's very important to plan ahead and organise my work. This will allow me to keep track of my progress, have an overview of the project as a whole. Also, in a real project it would help me prioritise parts of the game that may be more important or need more time than others.

After playing the game for a while I made a Spreadsheet for all the sounds that I seem to need to make.

I added the type of sounds that I’ll need to make. This gives a good first picture of what the game’s needs are, but keep in mind that all of these sounds need multiple variations, so the actual number of the SFX will multiply.

Lastly, to make the Lyra project a bit more unique, I added a new character asset to bring more life to the game. I’ll probably be adding more graphic elements here and there as I progress to make things more exciting.

Any feedback or advice throughout this blog series is much appreciated!

The first chapter of the blog will focus on the games' environment and ambience.
