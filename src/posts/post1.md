# Lyra Blog 0 - Setting Up

Hi all!

I decided to start blogging my progress on a portfolio project I just started. This project is a complete sound redesign of the sample game Lyra using Wwise. The aim of this redesign is not just sound replacement on pre-existing systems but to create my own with my own sounds attached to them. I decided to start this blog so I can share my work and knowledge while practising what I love. Any advice or feedback about the sound design or the implementation is much appreciated!

So what is Lyra? 

Lyra is..

To make it easier for people to follow the progression Iâ€™ll post a blog for each section of the game when it is completed. It seems that there would be around 6 blog posts in total covering (1) Environment-Ambience, (2) Animations, (3) Weapons, (4) Gameplay mechanisms/interactions, (5) Occlusion and Reverb, and (6) Mixing. Some of them may be lengthy since Iâ€™d like to focus on the multiplayer aspect of the game as well, therefore, I may end up breaking them into two parts. 

To start working on this project I need to set things up. So letâ€™s do it! 

Firstly, I integrated Wwise 2023.1.2 and Unreal Engine 5.2. I wanted to use Wwise because although Iâ€™m already familiar with it, this project will allow me to experiment more and potentially create more complex systems. Plus, Lyra already uses UEâ€™s internal tools (Metasounds) so it wouldnâ€™t be a technical challenge for me if all I had to do was replace my sounds. 

OK, Wwise is integrated. Now, letâ€™s make some noise! Or not ðŸ˜”.

Before I start working, it's very important to plan ahead and organise my work. This will allow me to keep track of my progress, have an overview of the project as a whole. Also, in a real project it would help me prioritise parts of the game that may be more important or need more time than others.

After playing the game for a while I made a Spreadsheet for all the sounds that I seem to need to make.

I added the type of sounds that Iâ€™ll need to make. The actual number will of course multiply if I include the variations of materials/weapons and the variations of sfx  that need to be made. However, this gives a good first picture of what the gameâ€™s needs are.

Lastly, to make the lyra project a bit more unique I added a new character to add a bit more life to the game. Iâ€™ll probably be adding more graphic bits here and there as I progress to make things more exciting.

Now, Iâ€™m ready to start adding sounds! On the next blog Iâ€™ll start working on the environment of the game adding ambience and source loops around the map.
